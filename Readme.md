## My Projects üöÄ

Here are a few projects I've tackled during my time at 42:
## Push Swap

**Push Swap** is a powerful sorting algorithm implemented in C. It efficiently sorts a stack of integers using a series of predefined operations, minimizing the number of moves required for sorting. The algorithm employs a doubly linked list data structure for efficient stack manipulation and offers versatility with different sorting techniques based on stack size.

## Dining Philosophers Problem

The **Dining Philosophers Problem** is a classic synchronization problem in computer science and concurrency theory. It illustrates the challenges of resource allocation and deadlock avoidance in a concurrent system. In this problem, a number of philosophers sit around a dining table with a bowl of spaghetti in front of each. Each philosopher alternates between thinking and eating. To eat, a philosopher needs to acquire two forks, one on their left and one on their right. However, only one philosopher can hold a fork at a time, leading to potential deadlock if all philosophers pick up their left fork simultaneously and then wait indefinitely for the right fork.

Solving the Dining Philosophers Problem involves devising strategies to ensure that each philosopher can eat without causing deadlock or starvation. Various synchronization techniques such as mutex locks, semaphores, and monitors can be employed to implement solutions that prevent deadlock and ensure fair resource allocation among the philosophers.

## Minitalk

**Minitalk** is a communication program that consists of a client and a server, enabling interprocess communication (IPC) between them. The program is designed to facilitate the transmission of messages from the client to the server in a lightweight and efficient manner.
